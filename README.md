## Sensitivity analysis for the design of multi-physical launchers.

This repository contains the work carried out at ONERA during my third year, under the supervision of two researchers in the signal processing
department. Within the frame os space engineering, this project was about getting familiar with a sensitivity indicator adapted to Multi-Disciplinary optimisation,
the Hilbert-Schmidt Independance Criterion (HSIC). More specifically, an estimator is computed for a simple case, and then a more realistic situation is considered.
You can also find an implementation of the LAMDA method to evaluate the PDF of a random variable through a Monte-Carlo method.

**OpenTurns**, a Python librairy dedicated to the computation of statistical quantities, is heavily utilized here.
