## ðŸš€ Sensitivity analysis for the design of multi-physical launchers.

This repository contains the work carried out at ONERA during my third year, under the supervision of two researchers in the signal processing
department. Within the frame os space engineering, this project was about getting familiar with a sensitivity indicator adapted to Multi-Disciplinary optimisation,
the Hilbert-Schmidt Independance Criterion (HSIC). This indicator is built upon the Kernel Methods machinery, making it all the more interesting to study
in a Machine Learning context.
An estimator of the HSIC is calculated, at first on a simplistic case, and then on the more realistic situation of a space satellite.
You can also find an implementation of the LAMDA method to evaluate the PDF of a random variable through a Monte-Carlo method, and of First Order
Reliability Method (FORM).

**OpenTurns**, a Python librairy dedicated to the computation of statistical quantities, is heavily utilized here.
